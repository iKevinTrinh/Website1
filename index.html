          <p>People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same problems every time. One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter. </p>

          <p>After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled. When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore. </p>

          <p>The wise man smiled and said:</p>

          <p>"You can't laugh at the same joke over and over so why are you always crying about the same problem?"</p>
